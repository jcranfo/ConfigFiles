keep and update my configuration files between various laptops and computational machines

The difference between the two folders is mostly about color scheme. Windows does not 
yet fully integrate with Ubuntu color schemes.  

The ClearLinks.sh script clears all hidden folders/files in the home directory that have
a file in the Windows or Ubuntu directory.  MAKE SURE TO PULL FILES FROM THE HOME DIRECTORY
INTO THE PROPER DIRECTORY BEFORE USING THIS SCRIPT.

The MakeLinks.sh script makes links in the home directory for all hidden files in the 
Windows or Ubuntu directory.  This code will NOT replace already existing folders or links.
